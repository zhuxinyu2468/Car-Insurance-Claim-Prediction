# Car Insurance Claim Prediction Project

This project is focused on analysing and predicting car insurance claims to tailor premiums and policies for each individual customer, ultimately improving customer experience and company profitability. The project is built upon the extraction, aggregation, and pre-processing of car insurance data from AWS Cloud.

## Features
- Extracted, aggregated, and pre-processed car insurance data from MySQL and AWS Cloud, enabling analysis of customer behavior and prediction of vehicle insurance claims.
- Utilized Python (Scikit-learn), Python (PySpark), Tableau, and SPSS Modeler to analyze and visualize the data.
- Conducted data pre-processing, cleaning, and feature selection to enhance data quality.
- Developed multiple supervised learning models to identify patterns in customer behavior and predict whether a car insurance claim is likely to be made based on relevant indicator attributes.
- Achieved the highest AUC of 0.89 in model evaluation, indicating strong predictive power.
- Proposed solutions to tailor premiums and policies for each individual customer based on predicted claim likelihood, aiming to improve customer experience and company profitability.
